# CreditCardFraudDetectionSystem

The objective of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting fraudulent or suspicious-looking credit card transactions in real-time in a production environment. This project aims to provide a model that can predict on a per transaction basis whether the transaction seems suspicious or not, depending upon both the transaction independent of the user and corroborated by the userâ€™s individual purchasing behaviour or history. 
 
This project aims to provide a way to identify fraudulent transactions from a forementioned data. Mitigation of fraud is left to the discretion of the providers/lenders themselves. A variety of options are available for this, such as manual verification and so forth.
